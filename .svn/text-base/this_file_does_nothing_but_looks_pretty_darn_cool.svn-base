   ::Survivor -> The Eye of the Tiger::
Risin' up, back on the street 
Did my time, took my chances 
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet 
Just a man and his will to survive 

So many times, it happens too fast 
You change your passion for glory 
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past 
You must fight just to keep them alive 

Chorus: 
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the cream of the fight 
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival 
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night 
And he's watchin' us all in the eye of the tiger 

Face to face, out in the heat 
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry 
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street 
For we kill with the skill to survive 

chorus 

Risin' up, straight to the top 
Have the guts, got the glory 
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop 
Just a man and his will to survive 

chorus 

The eye of the tiger (repeats out)...

Because a great beast deserves a great fricken song!!!!
Plus the song was stuck in your head...   Or will be :p

We.re no strangers to love,
You know the rules and so do I.
A full commitment.s what I.m thinking of,
You wouldnt get this from any other guy.

I just wanna tell you how I.m feeling,
Gotta make you understand.

Never gonna give you up,
Never gonna let you down,
Never gonna run around and desert you.
Never gonna make you cry,
Never gonna say goodbye,
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

We.ve known each other for so long
Your heart.s been aching
But you.re too shy to say it.
Inside we both know what.s been going on,
We know the game and we.re gonna play it.

Annnnnd if you ask me how I.m feeling,
Don.t tell me you.re too blind to see.

Never gonna give you up,
Never gonna let you down,
Never gonna run around and desert you.
Never gonna make you cry,
Never gonna say goodbye,
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

Never gonna give you up,

Give you up, give you up.
Never gonna give
Never gonna give, give you up.
Never gonna give
Never gonna give, give you up.
